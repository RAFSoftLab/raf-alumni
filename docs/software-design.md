# Software Design Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for a mobile application system, focusing on the integration between the Flutter mobile client, the Django REST API backend, and various data management services including PostgreSQL and Redis. It also details the integration with an external service that periodically sends course data via a webhook, and the implementation of push notifications through Firebase.

## Flutter Mobile Application (Client)

The Flutter mobile application acts as the primary interface for end-users. It is designed to offer a seamless and efficient user experience, enabling access to data and functionalities provided by the Django REST API.

### Key Features:
- Offers cross-platform support for both iOS and Android through the Flutter framework.
- Consumes RESTful services provided by the Django backend for dynamic data retrieval and manipulation.
- Implements caching strategies for frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce server load.

### Push Notifications:
- Receives push notifications from Firebase, which are sent through the Django REST API. This feature ensures users are promptly informed about important updates or events.

## Django REST API

The Django REST API serves as the middleware between the Flutter client, the data storage solutions, and Firebase for push notifications. It processes client requests, facilitates interactions with the PostgreSQL database and Redis cache, and manages communication with external services and Firebase.

### Components:
- **Django Framework:** Employs Django's capabilities for rapid development, enhanced security, and scalability.
- **Django REST Framework:** Aids in creating RESTful APIs to expose necessary endpoints for the Flutter application and the Firebase notification service.

### Database Interaction:
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Handles persistent data storage, including but not limited to user profiles and course information. Chosen for its robust features, scalability, and comprehensive query support.
- **Redis Cache:** Acts as a caching layer for data that is accessed frequently but changes infrequently, reducing the load on the PostgreSQL database and improving response times for such requests.

### Push Notification Workflow:
- The Django REST API interfaces with Firebase to send push notifications to the mobile application. This is triggered by specific events or updates within the system, ensuring timely communication with users.

## External Service Integration

The system integrates with an external service that sends course data periodically via a webhook. This allows for the automatic update of course information in real-time, without manual oversight over the external service.

### Workflow:
1. The external service triggers the webhook, delivering updated course data to a predetermined endpoint in the Django REST API.
2. The API processes and validates the incoming data before updating the corresponding records in the PostgreSQL database.
3. If the updated data affects entries currently cached in Redis, the cache is either invalidated or updated to maintain data consistency.

## Conclusion

This architecture outlines a comprehensive, scalable, and efficient system for managing and delivering course-related data to a Flutter mobile application. By leveraging Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis, coupled with real-time data updates via webhooks and push notifications through Firebase, the system ensures a dynamic and engaging user experience.
